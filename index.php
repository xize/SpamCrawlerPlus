 * this is a easy way to block spambots for 1. visiting your site,
 * 2. prevent spam by faking the website is dead for all spambots who are listed on stopforumspam!
 * 
 * we designed this especially for xenforo not as a addon but more likely to add in the library/config.php file.
 * however this may also work on other cms's if they extend or include their mysql class almost everywhere.
 * this will support cloudflare aswell but also the normal ip's.
 *  
 * since ive did for a small time research how those spambots are working.
 * its better to fake a dead with 404 errors rather than seeing them monitoring the site
 * and when nobody is on and trying to perform a capatcha bruteforce with the autolearn feature.
 * this also will lowering content scraping as it is probably also a part of the auto process learning.
